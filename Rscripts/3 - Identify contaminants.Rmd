# Check for contaminants in the dataset

# We aim to identify contaminants using the decontam package in R
# Visualise library sizes in each sample, label based on copd case-control status
df.libsize <- as.data.frame(sample_data(Final.ps)) 
df.libsize$LibrarySize <- sample_sums(Final.ps)
df.libsize <- df.libsize[order(df.libsize$LibrarySize),]

# Identify Contaminants - Frequency method 
# Sequences from contaminating ARGs are likely to have a frequency that inversely relates with sample DNA concentration (with correction factors)
# Create new column with DNA content with correction factor per sample - i.e. DNA_ngul_clariostar * TotalCorrectionMaxed
corrected.DNAinput <- Final.ps@sam_data$DNA_ngul_clariostar *
Final.ps@sam_data$TotalCorrectionMaxed
Final.ps@sam_data$correctedDNAinput <- corrected.DNAinput
contam.df.freq <- isContaminant(Final.ps, method="frequency", conc = "correctedDNAinput")
head(contam.df.freq)
table(contam.df.freq$contaminant) # 17 out of 233 ARGs are classified as contaminants
which(contam.df.freq$contaminant) # Names of the contaminants identified
taxa_names(Final.ps)[sample(which(contam.df.freq$contaminant))]

# Now we look at what a clear non-contaminant (e.g. 1st ARG), and a clear contaminant (e.g 11th ARG) look like:
plot_frequency(Final.ps, taxa_names(Final.ps)[c(1,16)], conc="correctedDNAinput") + xlab("correctedDNAinput")
# The dashed black line shows the model of a non contaminant sequence feature for which frequency is expected to be independent of the input DNA concentration. The red line shows the model of a contaminant sequence feature, for which frequency is expected to be inversely proportional to input DNA concentration, as contaminating DNA will make up a larger fraction of the total DNA in samples with very little total DNA. Gene 16  fits the red contaminant model better than ARG 1 (aadD_2_M19465). 
# Inspecting more of the ARGs that were classified as contaminants - to make sure they look like what we expect: 
set.seed(100)
plot_frequency(Final.ps,taxa_names(Final.ps)[sample(which(contamdf.freq$contaminant),6)], conc="correctedDNAinput") + xlab("correctedDNAinput")


# Identify Contaminants - Prevalence method 
# Since the likelihood of detecting any given contaminant sequence feature will be higher in the blanks than in true samples we can use this method.
# For each sequence feature, a chi-square statistic on the 2 × 2 presence-absence table in true samples and blanks is computed, and a score statistic P is de- fined as the tail probability of the chi-square distribution at that value. The p value from Fisher’s exact test is used as the score statistic instead if there are too few samples for the chi-square approximation. The score statistic ranges from 0 to 1. Small scores indicate the contaminant model of higher prevalence in blanks is a better fit. 
# In this method, the prevalence (presence/absence across samples) of each sequence feature in true samples COPD/control is compared to the prevalence in blanks to identify contaminants.
# In my phyloseq object, "copdcaco" is the sample variable that holds the COPD/control/blank status. We’ll summarize that data as a logical variable, with TRUE for blank samples, as that is the form required by isContaminant.
#In the prevalence test there is a special value worth knowing, threshold=0.5, that will identify as contaminants all sequences that are are more prevalent in blanks than in copd/control samples

# This method finds 4 ARGs as contaminants 
# Figure out which ARGs are flagged as the contaminants

taxa_names(Final.ps)[sample(which(contam.df.prev$contaminant))]
# prevalence based contaminant identification has identified fewer contaminants than frequency-based method 
# Make phyloseq object of presence-absence in negative controls and true samples
ps.pa <- transform_sample_counts(Final.ps, function(abund) 1*(abund>0))
ps.pa.neg <- prune_samples(sample_data(ps.pa)$copdcaco == "blanc", ps.pa)
ps.pa.pos <- prune_samples(sample_data(ps.pa)$copdcaco == c(1,0), ps.pa)
# Make data.frame of prevalence in positive and negative samples
df.pa <- data.frame(pa.pos=taxa_sums(ps.pa.pos), pa.neg=taxa_sums(ps.pa.neg),
                      contaminant=contam.df.prev$contaminant)
ggplot(data=df.pa, aes(x=pa.neg, y=pa.pos, color=contaminant)) + geom_point() +
  xlab("Prevalence (blanc samples)") + ylab("Prevalence (COPD and control Samples)")
# This graph shows that the ARGs seem to split pretty cleanly into a branch that shows up mostly in positive samples, and another that shows up mostly in negative controls, and the contaminant assignment (at default probability threshold) has done a good job of identifying those mostly in negative controls.

# Identify Contaminants - Combined method 
# This method combines the frequency-based and prevalence-based scores into a composite score - this approach has been shown to provide the most robust classifications when both DNA concentration and negative control data are available.
contam.df.comb <- isContaminant(
  Final.ps,
  conc = "correctedDNAinput",

# View ARG names of contaminants
taxa_names(Final.ps)[sample(which(contam.df.comb$contaminant))]

# In summary, number of ARGs flagged as contaminants by each method are: frequency = 17, prev =4, combined =8.
