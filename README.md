# VGO_COPDcaco_resistome
## The scripts in this repository are related to a COPD case-control study conducted with data from the VGO project which involves study participants living in a livestock dense region in the South Eastern Netherlands. The aim of the study is to determine: a) if the resisotme structure is different between COPD cases and controls, b) if livestock exposure is associated with the respiratory resistome structure. 

Background:
* COPD patients living close to farms have worse repiratory symptoms compared to those living further away.
* Possibly exposure to livestock-related microbial emissions is altering the respiratory resistome, contributing to these worse symptoms.
* Study designed a case-control nested within the VGO project (https://www.rivm.nl/veehouderij-en-gezondheid/onderzoek-veehouderij-en-gezondheid-omwonenden-vgo)

Scripts: 
* "Resistome_LURandRFmodels_20230719": this script applies exposure models previously developed for this study area in order to estimate residential exposure to livestock-related microbial emissions. It then examines the associations between this exposure and the respiratory resistome.
