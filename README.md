The scripts in this repository are related to a COPD case-control study conducted with data from the VGO project which involves study participants living in a livestock dense region in the South Eastern Netherlands. The aim of the study is to determine: a) if the resisotme structure is different between COPD cases and controls, b) if livestock exposure is associated with the respiratory resistome structure. 

## Description:
* COPD patients living close to farms have worse respiratory symptoms compared to those living further away.
* Possibly exposure to livestock-related microbial emissions is altering the respiratory resistome, contributing to these worse symptoms.
* Study designed a case-control nested within the VGO project (https://www.rivm.nl/veehouderij-en-gezondheid/onderzoek-veehouderij-en-gezondheid-omwonenden-vgo).

## Scripts: 
* See the repository "VGO_spatial_modelling" for scripts used to develop the exposure models applied in this study: https://github.com/BeatriceCornuHewitt/VGO_spatial_modelling.git
